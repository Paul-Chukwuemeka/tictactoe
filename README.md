# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This document provides information about the
Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in this project.

## Game Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3
grid. Players take turns placing their mark (X or
O) on an empty square. The first player to get
three of their marks in a row (horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally) wins. If all squares
are filled and no player has three in a row, the
game is a draw.
