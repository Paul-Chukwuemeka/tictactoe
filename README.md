# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This document provides information about the Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in this project.

## Game Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid.  Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) on an empty square. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
